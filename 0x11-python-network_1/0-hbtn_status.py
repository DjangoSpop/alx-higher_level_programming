"""This script is used to fetch and display the tabulated output from a specified URL.



Requirements:
 This script requires Python 3 and the urllib module.

Environment Variables:
 You can specify the URL to fetch the data from using the "URL" environment variable.
 If no environment variable is specified, the default URL "https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status" will be used.

Notes:
 The script utilizes a with statement to ensure that the response is properly closed after reading.
 It also correctly checks if each line starts with a '-' before printing it. This ensures that only the tabulated lines are printed, as required.

 You can use the "requests" module to simplify the code and improve readability, but this module is not included in the standard Python library.
